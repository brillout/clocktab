<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<h2>Our Pledge</h2>

<p>
  In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
  contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
  our community a constructive experience for everyone.
</p>

<h2>Our Standards</h2>

<p>
  Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
  include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
  <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
  <li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
  <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Insulting/derogatory comments and personal attacks</li>
  <li>Harassment</li>
  <li>Publishing others' private information</li>
  <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Responsibilities</h2>

<p>
  Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
  behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
  response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
</p>

<p>
  Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
  reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
  that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
  permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
  threatening, offensive, or harmful.
</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>
  This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
  when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
  representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
  address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
  representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
  further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
</p>

<h2>Enforcement</h2>

<p>
  Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
  reported by contacting the project team at {email}. All
  complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
  is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
  obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
  Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
</p>

<p>
  Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
  faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
  members of the project's leadership.
</p>
